    whatIsSin: {
      title: 'What is Sin?',
      content: `The concept of sin is quite simple: basically, sin is an act of exaggerated selfishness. It is preferring oneself, putting oneself before God and others, yielding to disordered passions that place us at the center of our existence, denying our nature, which is only complete when it opens to others and to God.

Sin is the rejection of establishing a relationship of love with God and others. It is "closing oneself to creatures" and "rejecting the Creator." In general, the sinner only desires the pleasures provided by creatures, and does not necessarily want to reject the Creator.

But, by allowing oneself to be seduced by the fleeting satisfactions provided by creatures, the sinner is implicitly acting against the love of the Creator, because they feel that earthly pleasure does not fulfill them, but still cannot resist it.

Therefore, sin wounds the sinner themselves, distancing them from the fullness offered by God. And therefore, sin offends God: not because God, as such, is affected, but because we ourselves, when we sin, diminish ourselves before the greatness that God offers us.

For Jesus, sin is born within man (cf. Mt 15:10-20). Therefore, interior transformation, of the heart, is necessary. For Jesus, sin is slavery: man lets himself be in the power of the evil one, falsely valuing the things of this world, letting himself be carried away by the immediate, by sensible satisfactions, which do not satisfy our thirst for love and fullness.

## What types of sin exist?

**Original Sin:** It is the inheritance we all receive from our first parents, Adam and Eve: they distrusted the love of God the Father and yielded to the temptation to leave him out of their personal choices. As children of a humanity that lost its innocence, we are all born with the fallen nature of sinners and need the grace of God, through the sacrament of Baptism, to purify our soul.

**Actual or Personal Sin:** It is what we commit as individuals, voluntarily and consciously. It can be committed in four ways:
- With thoughts
- With words
- With actions
- With omissions

And it can be against God, against neighbor or against ourselves.

## Mortal and Venial Sin

Personal sin can be **mortal** or **venial**:

1. **Venial Sin (light):** One we commit without full awareness or without full consent, but in light matter.
2. **Mortal Sin (grave):** Involves three simultaneous factors: full awareness, full consent and grave matter.

## What is grave matter and light matter?

The "matter" is the sinful "fact" itself.

**Grave matter:** Seriously wounds any of the 10 commandments. Some examples:
- Denying the existence of God
- Offending God or parents
- Killing or seriously injuring a person
- Putting oneself at serious risk of death without just reason
- Committing impure acts
- Stealing valuable objects
- Slandering
- Committing serious omissions in the fulfillment of duty
- Causing scandal to neighbor

**Light matter:** Does not seriously wound any of the 10 commandments, even if it consists of an act contrary to some of them.`,
      source: 'Aleteia',
    },
    mortalSins: {
      title: 'Mortal Sins',
      content: `When we commit a grave sin we expel God from us and lose sanctifying grace. That is why sin is the greatest disgrace that exists in the world.

To sin gravely is:
- To act against the will of God
- To attempt against His glory
- To offend the One who is infinitely good
- To deprive oneself of the grace of God
- To submit to the slavery of the Devil
- To become a candidate for Hell

## Definition

**Mortal sin** is thinking, desiring, saying, doing, or omitting something against the law of God in grave matter, knowing it and wanting it.

Three elements are necessary:
1. **Grave matter**
2. **Knowledge** (knowing it is a sin)
3. **Freedom** (wanting to do it)

## Examples of grave matter

- Not believing something taught by God and the Church, or worshiping other gods *(against the 1st commandment)*
- Blaspheming the Holy name of God, the Virgin and the Saints *(against the 2nd commandment)*

      title: 'Venial Sins',
      content: `There is another type of sin: **venial** or light sin.

This sin:
- Does not deprive the soul of the grace of God
- Does not condemn it to Hell

However, it:
- Prevents perfection
- Hinders the soul's journey toward God
- Leads to vice and the slavery of sin
- Causes relaxation of conscience
- Cools the love for God
- Can lead to more serious sins

## Definition

## Difference between Mortal and Venial

| Mortal Sin | Venial Sin |
|------------|------------|

      content: `The Catholic Church considers that every human being is, in essence, good. Therefore, for each of the 7 capital sins, there is an opposite virtue:

## The 7 Sins and their Virtues

| Sin | Virtue |
|-----|--------|
| **Pride** | Humility |
| **Greed** | Generosity |
| **Lust** | Chastity |
| **Envy** | Charity |
| **Gluttony** | Temperance |
| **Wrath** | Patience |
| **Sloth** | Diligence |

## Reflection

The practice of virtues is the way to overcome vices. It is not enough to avoid sin; we must actively cultivate the opposite virtue.

For example:
- To overcome **pride**, practice acts of **humility**
- To overcome **greed**, exercise **generosity**
- To overcome **wrath**, cultivate **patience**`,

## Words of Scripture

> "As the Father has sent Me, even so I send you... Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained."
> — John 20:21-23

> "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow."
> — Isaiah 1:18

> "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."
> — Matthew 9:13

## The Power of the Priest

Saint John Chrysostom teaches:

> "Men have received from God a power that has not been given to angels or archangels. It was never said to heavenly spirits: 'Whatever you bind and loose on earth shall be bound and loosed in heaven.' The princes of this world can only bind and loose the body. The power of the priest goes further; it reaches the soul, and is exercised not only in baptizing, but even more in forgiving sins."

## Practical Advice

- Do not be afraid to confess to the priest any impure sin you have committed
- Do not hide or try to disguise it
- The priest is there to help and forgive
- Nothing you say will scandalize him

**Remember:** Confess your sins with supernatural repentance, having a firm resolution not to sin again and to avoid situations that lead to sin.`,

      content: `## Preparation

First of all, **examine your conscience well**.

Then tell the priest:
- What specific sins you committed
- As accurately as possible, how many times you committed them since your last good confession

## What to confess

You are only **obliged** to confess mortal sins, since you can obtain forgiveness for venial sins through sacrifices and acts of charity.

> **Tip:** If you are in doubt whether a sin is mortal or venial, mention your doubt to the confessor.

Confession of venial sins is also recommended, as it greatly helps to avoid sin and advance toward Heaven.

## Conditions for a sin to be mortal

1. **Serious matter** - the act itself is grave
2. **Sufficient reflection** - knowing it is a sin
3. **Full consent** - choosing to do it freely

## Important warnings

- **Deliberately hiding** a mortal sin invalidates the confession, and is itself a mortal sin
- Confession is **private** and subject to the **Seal of Confession**
- It is a mortal sin for a priest to reveal to anyone the matter of a confession`,

    spiritualDirection: {
      title: 'Spiritual Direction',
      content: `If you have spiritual direction, you already know the importance of this guidance for keeping the interior life going and, in general, for progressing in the Christian life.

## Why have a spiritual director?

The Church has always recommended spiritual direction to all who wish to mature seriously in the Christian life, analogous to:
- A heart patient who seeks the guidance of a cardiologist
- An athlete who has a coach to prepare and guide them

**No one is a good coach of themselves.**

## Teaching of Saint Josemaría Escrivá

> "You should know this sure doctrine: one's own spirit is a bad pilot, to guide the soul in the storms and tempests, among the reefs of the interior life. Therefore, it is God's will that the direction of the ship be entrusted to a Master, so that, with his light and knowledge, he may lead us to a safe port."
> — The Way, n. 59

## The Good Shepherd

The confessor and, in general, the person who attends to the spiritual direction of others, participates in the mission of the Good Shepherd:

- Knows his sheep and they know him
- Shows them the way
- Leads them to good pastures
- Defends them from thieves and the wolf (cf. Jn 10:4-14)
- Seeks those who have strayed to help them return (cf. Lk 15:4-7)

## How to choose a director

The good spiritual director must be a reflection of Jesus, the Good Shepherd.

**Important:** Ask the Holy Spirit for lights to choose well the director — always with full freedom, but with the sincere desire to advance spiritually.`,

Saint Augustine said that whoever prays well, lives well; whoever lives well, dies well; and for whoever dies well, all is well.

Saint Alphonsus teaches: *"Whoever prays much will be saved. Whoever prays little puts their eternal salvation at risk."*

## 10 Tips for Growing in Prayer

### 1. Have conviction and determination
No one succeeds in any area of life without determination. Athletes, musicians, scholars did not get where they are just by wishing.

### 2. Hire the Holy Spirit as teacher
Saint Paul teaches us that we do not know how to pray as we ought, and that it is the Holy Spirit who intercedes for us. Before beginning any moment of prayer, invoke the Holy Spirit to enlighten your mind and set your heart on fire.

### 3. Dedicate time, space, goodwill and silence
Like any art is learned by practice, this also applies to prayer. Choose a specific time, a good place, put the best of yourself into it and make interior silence.

### 4. Do penance
If your prayer has become boring and you are no longer growing spiritually, it may be due to neglect in the life of penance. Consult a good spiritual director and start with small acts.

### 5. Seek spiritual direction
Athletes need coaches; students need teachers. Prayer warriors need a guide.

### 6. Pray and live the action
An authentic life of prayer reaches its fullness in the progressive practice of virtues: faith, hope, charity, purity, kindness, service, humility.

### 7. Study and read about prayer
Saint Teresa of Ávila did not accept nuns into her convent who could not read. The saint knew how important it is to learn about prayer through solid spiritual reading.

### 8. Participate in retreats
Retreats allow for a more prolonged dedication to prayer. One of the most effective styles are Ignatian retreats.

### 9. Confess regularly
Sometimes prayer becomes very difficult because our conscience is dirty with sin. Jesus said: *"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God"* (Mt 5:8).

### 10. Count on Our Lady
After invoking the Holy Spirit, ask for Mary's intercession for you, and invite her to be at your side every time you dedicate time to prayer. **She never fails.**`,
